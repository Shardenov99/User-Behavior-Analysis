<h1 align="center"> User Purchase Timing & Behavior Analysis üì¶</h1>

<br>

## Project Overview
This project analyzes user behavior on an e-commerce website, focusing on how long it takes for users to make a purchase after first arriving on the site. The goal is to provide insights into daily progression of user purchase duration to support data-driven decisions for product, marketing, and UX teams.

## Main Task ‚è±Ô∏è
- Calculate the time elapsed from a user's first arrival on the website on a given day to their first purchase on the same day.
- Aggregate these durations to display daily trends, highlighting typical and outlier behaviors.

## Extra Analyses
In addition to the main task, the project explores:

### 1. Sales Funnel by Device Type
- Analyzes how purchasing behavior differs across **desktop**, **mobile**, and **tablet** users.

### 2. Traffic Source Analysis
- Investigates where users are coming from (e.g., referral, direct, organic, paid channels).

### 3. Preferred Purchase Hours
- Identifies daily and hourly trends to understand peak purchase times.
